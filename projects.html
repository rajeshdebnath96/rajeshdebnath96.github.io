            <p>In this project we analyzed english tweets dataset to detect suicidal ideation using BERT and later used multilingual model XLM-ROBERTa 
                on english and spanish tweets dataset. </p>

            <p>In this term project, we did an experiment on Neural Machine Translation(NMT) for Bangla to English Translation. 
                We used a moderate size dataset containing 4379 sentence translations from English to Bangla. We used seq2seq 
                encoder-decoder model containing Word2Vec and LSTMs with and without attention for small epochs. With finely tuned 
                hyperparameters, we observed that using Bahdanau's attention with the vanilla encoder-decoder model improves the 
                BLEU score for Bangla to English translation. </p>

            <div class="portfolio-container_text">
                    
                <p>In this work, we developed a posture corrector android application that can detect unusual bending of the user. 
                    The application is connected with a wearable device containing Arduino and flex sensor. A user wearing a dress 
                    containing the device gets a notification in his application if he bends in a way that is harmful to his posture. 
                    Later a small physical motor was also introduced with the device that will force the user to correct his posture 
                    in case he doesn't has his phone nearby. However, the work was done for term project purpose and not commercially 
                    deployable.</p>

            <div class="portfolio-container_text">    
                
            <p>In this term project, a cross-platform application was developed for travelers inside Bangladesh. 
                Using the app, anyone can easily find the popular tourist places in Bangladesh, see user reviews and available 
                accommodations nearby the place, view the places with high risks and get suggestions on how to avoid them. 
                The project was deployed using AngularJs framework Ionic for frontend and a Python Django server for backend; 
                the communication between frontend and backend was established using a REST API.

                <p>In this term project, an android game named glowhockey was deployed in a board containing 4 LED matrices. 
                    The gamers could use the gyro sensor in their hands to move the glowing hockey sticks in the board. 
                    The sensors and LED matrix were governed by an ATMega32 microprocessor which was programmed in C

                <p>In this project, an application named FoodiesDhaka was developed using JavaFX and MySQL. 
                    In this application, the app users are provided with a choice of restaurants according to different areas in 
                    Dhaka city and they can see the user reviews and ratings for the restaurants. They can also suggest adding new 
                    restaurants in the list that can be further reviewed and checked by the admin side. The communication is done using 
                    Java Networking. However, the whole project was done in the localhost for term project purpose and is not 
                    deployable commercially. </p>
